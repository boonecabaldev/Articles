## Projects

Here are some other projects, which were very pleasurable.

### Software

- [Colemak Popup](https://github.com/boonecabaldev/colemak-extension): Chrome browser extension that pops a dialog box that allows you to type using the colemak keyboard layout within Chrome, allowing you to use colemak from computers with restricted permissions.
- [CodeLocker](https://github.com/boonecabaldev/CodeLocker): WinForms application with unbreakable User Interface that encryts (locks) a code or randomly generated password for a specified duration, afterwhich you can unlock and view it; this is called a time lock, or code lock. Alternatively, can specify a future expiration date and time for the code lock.

### Video(s)
